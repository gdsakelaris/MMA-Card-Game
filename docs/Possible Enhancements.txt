Strategic Depth Enhancements

1. Deck Building System
Currently all decks are identical. Allow players to:
•	Choose their roster: Select 10-15 fighters from a larger pool (30+ fighters)
•	Customize technique ratios: Choose how many of each technique type to include
•	Create archetype decks: Pure striker, pure grappler, or hybrid builds
•	Unlock system: Start with basic fighters, unlock elite fighters through wins

        2. Stance System
        Add tactical stances fighters can adopt:
        •	Aggressive Stance (+2 damage, -1 defense) - costs 1 energy
        •	Defensive Stance (+3 defense, -1 damage) - costs 1 energy
        •	Pressure Stance (+10% takedown success) - costs 1 energy
        •	Counter Stance (next successful defense deals double counter damage) - costs 2 energy
        •	Stances persist until changed, adding layer of positioning

        3. Combo System
        Reward sequential play with combo bonuses:
        •	Strike chains: Playing 2+ strikes in one turn grants +1 damage to each after the first
        •	Grappling pressure: Successive takedown attempts increase success chance by +5% each
        •	Submission chains: Already exists, but add visual combo counter
        •	Mixed combos: Strike → Takedown → Ground and Pound gets a "Perfect Transition" bonus

4. Fighter Fatigue/Momentum
Add a momentum/fatigue mechanic:
•	Successful attacks build momentum tokens (max 3)
•	Spend momentum for power moves or to re-roll failed takedowns
•	Taking damage builds fatigue - reduces stats temporarily
•	Creates ebb and flow like real MMA rounds


Tactical Options

•	Must hold energy between turns to use

8. Advanced Defense Options
Expand defensive play:

9. Fight IQ / Special Abilities
Give each fighter a unique signature ability:
•	Islam: "Sambo Control" - +15% submission success from top

•	Oliveira: "Do Bronx" - Submissions from bottom only -30% penalty instead of -40%
•	Adds personality and matchup-specific strategies

10. Game Plan Cards
Pre-fight planning phase:
•	Choose a game plan before fight: "First Round Finish", "Grind", "Point Fighting"
•	Game plans grant bonuses if you stick to the strategy
•	"First Round Finish": +3 damage in round 1, -2 defense in later rounds
